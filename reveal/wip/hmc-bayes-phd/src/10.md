## Analyze pathologies

Various consideration can be done about pathologies.

#### Geometric ergodicity

This property guarantees ideal behaviour

<span class="txtclr red">&cross;</span> it's hard to prove for a generic model

#### Detection

Empirical statistics can be used as diagnostics for pathologies, e.g. split
$\hat{R} \sim 1$.
