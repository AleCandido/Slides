## Factorization

The non-perturbative ingredient that we have in our processes is precisely the
proton structure.

So our **hadronic** cross-sections, $\sigma_h$, will always be computed using
the perturbatively computed **partonic**, $\sigma_i$, but also the
non-perturbative information $f_i$.

$$
\sigma_h
= \sum_i f_i \otimes \hat{\sigma}_i
$$

<p style="font-style: italic">
  The ingredient $f_i$ is actually an <strong>universal</strong> object, that does not depend on
  the specific process.

## Renormalized PDF

Analogously to what is done in UV renormalization, we can redefine our PDF in
order to account for all the non-perturbative behavior.

Even if in principle here it would not be wrong to use the na√Øve object.
</p>

Indeed, since they are non-perturbative quantities, the PDF may be considered as
parameters in our perturbative calculations.

<div style="font-style: italic; text-align: left">
  <p style="font-size: 0.6em; margin-bottom: 0.2em">
  The PDFs are not parameters, they may be computed as Operator Matrix
  Elements, but their determination is currently done only by experimental data.

  In the next future it is possible that we'll have a PDF determination on the <strong>lattice</strong>.

## Factorization Scheme

The redefinition it's done in such a way that the divergences in $\hat{\sigma}_0$
are absorbed by $f_0$.

<div class="fact-formula" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin:0.1em">
  $$
  \sigma_h
  = \sum_i f_{i, 0} \otimes \hat{\sigma}_{i, 0}
  = \sum_i f_i^{\mathcal{F}} \otimes \hat{\sigma}_i^{\mathcal{F}}
  $$
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 0">
  The arbitrariness in the redefinition of the finite part is the content of the
  <strong>factorization scheme</strong> $\mathcal{F}$.

## PDF after LO

The PDF $f_i(z)$ at LO were actually defined as:

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
  the probability distribution of the component $i$ of the proton to carry
  a momentum fraction $z$
</p>

But after including the further non-perturbative contribution coming from the
collinear divergences (essentially adding them) they have been treated as
regular functions, so they are <em>no longer probabilities</em>.

<div style="font-size: 0.8em">
  <h5 style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0.1em">Self-promotion</h5>
  <p style="margin: 0">
  Actually in a recent work by S. Forte, F. Hekhorn and me, it has been proved
  that PDF are still positive objects in some physically and computationally
  relevant <strong>factorization schemes</strong> even after the LO.
