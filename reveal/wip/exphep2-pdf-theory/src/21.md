## $x$-space solution

The DGLAP equaation it's an integro-differential equation in 2 dimensions.

A possible way of solving this equations is to exploit a numerical integration
for both the dimensions, and evolve a given initial condition.

This is called $x$-space solution in contrast to what we'll see in a while, and
it is the approach followed by evolution libraries like `HOPPET` and:
