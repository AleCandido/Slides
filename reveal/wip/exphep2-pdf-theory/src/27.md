## What's the magic?

Seems like we _avoided_ the computation of an integral, but it is still hidden in
the result: we are still in $N$-space, but to go back an **inverse transform** it's
still needed, and it will involve a complex contour integration.

$$
\mathcal{M}^{-1}\[\tilde{f}\](x) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\mathcal{C}} x^{-N}
\tilde{f}(N) \text{d}N
$$

But actually few of them are needed, because of the diagonalized shape of
$P_{ij}$.
