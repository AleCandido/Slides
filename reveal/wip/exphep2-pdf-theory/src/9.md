## Renormalized PDF

Analogously to what is done in UV renormalization, we can redefine our PDF in
order to account for all the non-perturbative behavior.

Even if in principle here it would not be wrong to use the na√Øve object.

Indeed, since they are non-perturbative quantities, the PDF may be considered as
parameters in our perturbative calculations.

  The PDFs are not parameters, they may be computed as Operator Matrix
  Elements, but their determination is currently done only by experimental data.

  In the next future it is possible that we'll have a PDF determination on the <strong>lattice</strong>.
