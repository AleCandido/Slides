## Applying constraints

<img src="assets/fit-flow.png" alt="fit flow">

There are two ways of implementing the constraints:

- in the **loss function**, use _Lagrange multipliers_ to enforce a weight
- as a **post-selection**
  - i.e. remove replicas that do not respect some conditions
  - (expensive, post-selection should do almost nothing)
