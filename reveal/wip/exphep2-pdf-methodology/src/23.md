## Constraints

Another _requirement_ we would like to add to our result is to provide physical
objects:

- the PDF should respect **sum rules** (momentum and number)
- moreover it should make the **physical observables positive**
  - remember that from NLO PDF are just functions, and this property it's not
    guaranteed
