# Presentation structures

Presentation structures to be build with jinja.

The main goals are:
- to have reusable presentations layout
- to organize slides in more files, instead of the single `index.html`, that
    instead is built by jinja

## Organization
Each folder will contain the structure template with jinja syntax and a
configuration file in yaml to be read with variables configuration
