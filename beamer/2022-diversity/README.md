# Diversity talk

Gargnano 2022

## Motivation

- Diversity matters, and Inclusion should be one of the most basic forms of
  respect

  - being biased without a good theoretical motivation is once more a source of
    problems

- NNPDF is not really diverse
  - white, male, western
- potentially theoretical physics in general is even worse

- wildcard to say a lot of things that

## Content

### Introduction

- what is DEI?
- world population is going to increase
  - growth prospect from [WPP
    2022](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/World-Population-Prospects-2022)
  - we'll have more manpower -> more people creating amazing ideas and working
    towards their realization
  - we need to improve our relationship, in order to positively interfere
  - most of the growth won't come from Europe (WPP 2022, world map, population
    growth per country as color)
  - diversity is a global challenge

### Physics Metaphors

- being passive (not assertive) is not an issue
  - but not assertive people are getting a poorer experience
    - they are delegated to less relevant tasks
    - they have to take minutes
    - they are not getting their names on paper (but other members are getting
      it, having done a comparable amount of work)
- relocation
  - so called "two body problem"
  - it is actually a "many body problem"
  - our network of connections matters:
    - it makes us safer and secure
    - it gives us a positive environment we all could benefit from
- imposter syndrome
- micro-dynamics -> macro effects
  - no one is the problem, and no one the solution
    - since the problem and the solution are visible only on big numbers
  - but we all are the problem, and we all can be part of the solution, with a
    proper and dedicated effort
    - single outliers are not the problem
    - but the wrong and consistent choices to which people are used to are
      (micro-dynamics)
    - and they are the origin of the observed issues (macro effects)
- majority is not inclusion
  - minorities are richness, they bring a different point of view
- Georgi talk
  - Physics in a diverse world or A Spherical Cow Model of Physics Talent
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09485
  - our mind as physicists sometimes deserve formal abstractions
    - _by the way_: let's learn to face problems even without
  - Georgi is giving us a non-trivial model
    - how can we use it?
- the role of demographics
  - statistics helps dealing with collective properties of large groups
  - inclusive metrics simplify the problem
    - but in this way the give us a way to deal with an otherwise incredibly
      difficult issue
  - the road is clear: let's go as differential as possible
    - we should be sensitive to more characteristics of the individuals
    - **people unfolding**

## Perspective

We should periodically have a talk on diversity, different speakers in charge.

Plenty of smart people in the field, and very clever people in this very same
room: we work every day together to solve difficult physics problem.
Now we have a problem, and it's not easier than those we are used to: the best
way to give something back is to exploit your talents (your intelligence in this
case) in the very same way you are used to.
**People are not less important then physics.**

## Conclusion

NNPDF has not to become a political platform for fancy ideas (picture of sticky
man behind a stand at a rally, with NNPDF logo on the T-shirt).

But we **have to** create an inclusive and friendly environment.
Physics will benefit from this -- but more important we'll all benefit from this

Let's do our ~~part~~ best!
