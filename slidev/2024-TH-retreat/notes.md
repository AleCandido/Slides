# Quantum computing

- efficient quantum building blocks are just a few
- complexity in training QML is more evident (mention research on barren plateaus)

Therefore, to deploy truly efficient quantum algorithms, it is fundamental to have control
over the whole infrastructure.

Both hybrid computing and consuming quantum data require tighter integration with the
actual computing hardware.

## Hybrid computing

We're trying to move our infrastructure closer to the hardware, to remove execution
bottlenecks generated by transmission overhead and latency.

## Quantum data

This also requires a close control on the hardware itself.

## In our framework

We're trying to get these benefits not for one-shot applications, but integrating them
consistently in a framework that could be used to support various applications.
