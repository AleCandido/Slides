# Theory covariance matrix - requisites

<div m="y-24"/>

- the theory covariance has to be ***generated by some shift vectors*** $\Delta_i(\vec{\kappa})$ -
  the vectors should be *proportional to the difference of predictions* obtained
  by a theory variation $T_i(\vec{\kappa})$ and the default theory in which
  $\vec{\kappa} = \vec{\kappa}_0$
$$
\Delta_i(\vec{\kappa}) = c_i(\vec{\kappa}) \left(T_i(\vec{\kappa}) - T_i(\vec{\kappa}_0)\right)\\
S_{ij} = \sum_{\vec{\kappa} \in \mathcal{V}_{ij}} \Delta_i(\vec{\kappa})\Delta_j(\vec{\kappa})
$$

<div m="y-12"/>

- it has to be also ***positive semi-definite***, as required for any covariance matrix
$$
v_i S_{ij} v_j > 0 \qquad \forall v \in \R^{n_\text{data}}
$$

# Alternative prescriptions

<div m="y-12"/>

It is possible to restrict the arbitrary normalization $c_i(\vec{\kappa})$ with
a sets of reasonable constraints:

- **isomorphic spaces**: for each pair of disjoint data sets, the prescription
  space should be the same (it might be different for on/off-diagonal, but
  always independent on the data set)
- **normalization**: the normalization of the theory covmat should not scale
  (i.e. depend) with the size of the prescription space (the cardinality of the
  finite set)

<div m="y-16"/>

However, there is a unique choice with two sensible options:

- <b>fully factorized space</b>: together with the other requisites, it generates a
  unique set of prescriptions (one for each $n$-points)
- <b>$\kappa_F$-sliced space</b>: the factorization scale is rather special, so
  instead of considering a space that is factorized with that as well, it is
  possible to just accept that the space is fully factorized for each value of
  the factorization scale $\kappa_F$
