# Factorization

The QCD property allowing PDFs definition

$$
\sigma_{dis} = \hat{\sigma} \otimes f + \textit{non-leading powers}\\
\sigma_h = \hat{\sigma} \otimes f \otimes f + ...
         \equiv \hat{\sigma} \otimes \mathcal{L} + ...
$$

where:
- $\sigma$ is the prediction for the physical observable, to be compared with
    the experimental measurement
- $f$ is the PDF
- $\hat{\sigma}$ is the *coefficient function*

$\otimes$ is a convolution
$$
a \otimes b (x) \equiv \int_x^1 \text{d}z ~ a(z) b(x/z)
$$
and a sum over flavors is implicit

Factorization ensures **PDFs universality**: the PDF determined from some processes
is the same for any other involving the same initial-state hadron.
